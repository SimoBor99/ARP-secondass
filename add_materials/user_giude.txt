# ARP Second assignment

Installing and running
----------------------------------------------
Before running the program with shell file, it is fundamental to install two libraries:
lncurses and libbitmap.

For installing lncurses, you can run on the terminal the following command:

``` sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev```

For installing libbitmap, you can download the repository from github, by doing:

``` git clone https://github.com/draekko/libbitmap```

Navigate to the root directory of the downloaded repo and run the configuration through command ``` ./configure```. Configuration might take a while. While running, it prints some messages telling which features it is checking for.

Type ``` make``` to compile the package.

Run ``` sudo make install``` to install the programs and any data files and documentation.
Upon completing the installation, check if the files have been properly installed by navigating to /usr/local/lib, where you should find the libbmp.so shared library ready for use.
In order to properly compile programs which use the libbitmap library, you first need to notify the linker about the location of the shared library. To do that, you can simply add the following line at the end of your .bashrc file:

``` export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"```

After doing that, it is the time to create the binary of all 3 processes and run the programm. Before running it, you need to make second.sh executable, by using on the terminal:

``` chmod u+x second.sh```

You can find second.sh into ```add_materials``` folder, but, when launched, this file must be in the same folder of the project. 
Then launch it to create all binary and execute the program, by the command:

```./second.sh```

Once you have done this, the program is successfully launched!

Description of the program
----------------------------------------------

This program simulates a typical vision system, able to track an object in a 2-D plane.
After starting, the program spawns two different konsole windows: one for the camera where a RGB image of the object will be displayed (process A) and one for simulating the extraction of a feature from the image (process B).
More precisely, in the process A window it is possible to do two things:
* moving the image, using the arrow keys on your keyboard;
* pressing the 'P' button, which will make the program take a snaphot of the image and save it on a .bpm file, inside the 'out' folder.

The movement of the image is not completely free: in fact, there are horizonthal and vertical bounds, which will stop the image from going further (IMPORTANT NOTE: the walls are NOT visible, the image will just stop and won't go any further in that direction).

On the process B window, the center of the image will be shown, which is the extracted feature.
If we move the image on the process A, the center of the image on process B will also move, and leave the image trajectory behind itself.

The program can be closed by pressing ctrl+C on the terminal window from where you launched the program.

Development of the program
----------------------------------------------

The program consists in three processes:

* Master process

This is the process which creates, truncates the segment of shared memory and starts everything: after starting its execution, this process spawns two other processes, passing them, as argument, the name of shared memory. When the user presses ctrl+c on keyboard, this process must send two signals for kill children processes and close file descriptor, unmap its memory address and then unlink the segment memory.

* Process A

This process shows a grapich interface, where there are a sort of green "cross" and a P button. If the P button is pressed, a screenshot of the image is captured and saved. Process A has the task to register as bmp file, in the shared memory, the current position of the circle in the 80x30 px area. Firstly it creates the image of the circle, with a readius of 30 px and spawns it in the middle of the area, then, every time the user presses any arrow buttons on the keyboard, it creates a new image of the current position of the figure, which replaces the old one. The resolution of image is 1600x600 px, so there is a factor of 20x in the building of it. Actually the process does not share the bmp file in the shared memory, because it is a dynamic structure; there is one more step for doing that: it copies, bit for bit, the whole structure into an array of char and, obviously, shares it.

* Process B

This process shows a grapich interface, where at the beggining there is a 0 in the middle. It continuosly reads the data from shared memory, converts them into a bitmap file, which size is now 80x30 px, so it resizes the image dividing by a factor of 20x; then it has to find the current center of the circle, and, finally, draws the trajectory of it. For finding the center of the circle, process B scans the whole bitmap file and, after scanning 30 adjacent colored pixel, it register the position of the center. Trajectory consists in a sort of vertical and horizontal hyphens, and 0 represents where is the center. Actually the position of the center  in an almost real time, because there is some delay in reading the shared memory and in rebuilding the image.


User Guide
----------------------------------------------

Once you have followed the guide on README file, that is in our github repository https://github.com/SimoBor99/ARP-secondass and is mandatory before to keep on reading this guide, the first two things that you can see are graphical interfaces of konsole, which are described below. Do not worry if the two interface are bugged; sometimes it happens and, for fixing it, resize them with mouse, and everything will be fine.

In the first one you can see:
* A p button, that if it is pressed by clicking the mouse, takes a screenshot of the image. Actually it is not a screenshot of the green cross, but a blue circle that is simplier to codify as a bitmap file. This image is saved into out folder, that is in the same directory of the project. If you press several times the button, several images are saved. So there is no replacement.
* A green cross, that is the image which you can iteract by pressing any arrow buttons on the keyboard; even if the user makes the window full screen, the cross is constrained to move in an area of 80x30 px; so do not worry if after certain time, the cross does not move even if you are continuosly pressing the upper or lower arrow; probabily it reaches the bounds. 

In the second one you can see:
At the beggining you can see a zero in the middle of the screen; it is stands for the current position of the center of the cross. If you move it, in the other window, you can see several vertical ( if you have pressed upper or lower arrows) or horizontal ( if you have pressed left or right arrows) hyphens, that stand for the trajectory, and, if you stop to move the cross, zero which stands for the current position of the center. So as recap:
* hyphens stands for the trajectory, the motion ot the center;
* zero stands for the current center, or even better the last position of the center.

If you want to terminate this program, you can simply press ctrl+c on the terminal window, and everythin will disappear.
